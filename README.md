ðŸŒŸ Welcome to My C Exercises Repository! ðŸŒŸ

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This repo is filled with my C programming exercises from college. Iâ€™ve done my best to explain my logic in pseudocode, but sometimes I forget to update it. So, I apologize if you spot any mismatches!

If you encounter any issues with the code, please feel free to create an issue. And if you have more efficient solutions, Iâ€™d love for you to submit a pull request!

Thanks for checking it out! Happy coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
